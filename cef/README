To generate compatible .NET-types and make the sample app work, they need to be
able to find a matching version of the CEF. Download a binary distribution from
http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html and extract files to this
directory. Copy Resources/icudtl.dat into the Release directory.

The resulting directory structure looks like this:
include/
Release/
Resources/
LICENSE.txt
README.txt
etc...
